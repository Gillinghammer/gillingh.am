          | I consider myself a bit of a startup nomad these days. Originally from Wisconsin in the US but spent over seven years working in California.

It was an opportunity of a lifetime and I learned a ton about optimizing our internal tools to keep up with the pace set by our founder & CEO, Elon Musk.

          | Since then I took the opportunity to travel, learn how to code and recharge my own batteries ;) I just finished living in London for two years working as a Product & Engineering Manager for a Computer Vision startup. Now I've landed in Portugal hoping to get plugged into the thriving startup scene.
